**GLOSA-BHARAT** (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory) is a high-fidelity Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) ecosystem designed to eliminate urban traffic friction and fuel wastage using indigenous AI. Aligned with India's **Smart City** initiatives, it provides real-time speed advisories to drivers, allowing them to pass through traffic signals during the green phase without stopping.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🚀 Real-time Speed Advisory**: Calculates and displays the optimal speed to catch the next green light.
- **🧠 Indigenous AI Core**: Custom-trained models (YOLOv8) optimized for heterogeneous Indian traffic (Bikes, Autos, Vans).
- **📊 Digital Twin Dashboard**: A futuristic Leaflet-based GIS dashboard for traffic authorities to monitor congestion and signal health.
- **⚡ Low-Latency Orchestration**: High-speed Node.js middleware for sub-second data routing.
- **🌱 Fuel & Emission Reduction**: Potential 15-20% reduction in fuel consumption and PM2.5 emissions.
- **🛰️ Hardware-Agnostic**: Works with existing government CCTV infrastructure—no expensive LIDAR needed.

## 🍃 MongoDB Setup & Compass Connection

To visualize the real-time traffic data in **MongoDB Compass**:

1. **Install MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB Community Server is installed on your Windows machine.
2. **Open Compass**: Launch MongoDB Compass and click "New Connection".
3. **Connection String**: Use `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`
4. **Initial Data**: Run `node scripts/seed.js` inside the `backend` folder to populate initial junction data.
5. **Database Name**: Look for the `glosa-bharat` database in the sidebar.
